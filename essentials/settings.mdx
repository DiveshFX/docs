## 1.1 What is RSA

RSA is an \*\*asymmetric \*\*encryption algorithm. It uses a **key pair**:

- A **public key** to encrypt data or verify signatures
- A **private key** to decrypt data or sign messages

It is commonly used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and authentication.

### 1.2 RSA Key Generator

The RSA Key Generator allows you to generate a public and private key pair directly in the browser.

#### Available Settings

- **Bits**
  - Defines the key length
  - Common values: 1024, 2048, 4096
  - Recommendation: use 2048 bits or higher for better security
- **Format**
  - PKCS#1
  - PKCS#8
  - PKCS#5
  - PKCS#8 is recommended for modern applications
- **Passphrase**
  - Optional
  - Encrypts the private key with a password
  - Adds an extra layer of security
- **Auto Update**
  - Regenerates keys automatically when settings change
- **Remember Input**
  - Keeps your settings saved in the browser

### 1.3 How to Generate RSA Keys

1. Open the RSA Key Generator page
2. Select the desired **Bits** value
3. Choose the **Format**
4. Optionally enable **Passphrase** and enter a password
5. Click **Generate**
6. The tool will output:
   - **Private Key** (keep this secret)
   - **Public Key** (safe to share)

You can copy or download each key using the icons provided.

### 1.4 How RSA Is Typically Used

- Encrypt small data such as AES keys
- Verify digital signatures
- Secure authentication systems

For large data encryption, RSA is usually combined with AES.
