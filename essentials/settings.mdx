## 1. What is RSA

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm. It uses a **key pair**:

- A **public key** to encrypt data or verify signatures
- A **private key** to decrypt data or sign messages

It is commonly used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and authentication.

### RSA Key Generator

The RSA Key Generator allows you to generate a public and private key pair directly in the browser.

#### Available Settings

- **Bits**
  - Defines the key length
  - Common values: 1024, 2048, 4096
  - Recommendation: use 2048 bits or higher for better security
- **Format**
  - PKCS#1
  - PKCS#8
  - PKCS#5
  - PKCS#8 is recommended for modern applications
- **Passphrase**
  - Optional
  - Encrypts the private key with a password
  - Adds an extra layer of security
- **Auto Update**
  - Regenerates keys automatically when settings change
- **Remember Input**
  - Keeps your settings saved in the browser

### How to Generate RSA Keys

1. Open the RSA Key Generator page
2. Select the desired **Bits** value
3. Choose the **Format**
4. Optionally enable **Passphrase** and enter a password
5. Click **Generate**
6. The tool will output:
   - **Private Key** (keep this secret)
   - **Public Key** (safe to share)

You can copy or download each key using the icons provided.

### How RSA Is Typically Used

- Encrypt small data such as AES keys
- Verify digital signatures
- Secure authentication systems

For large data encryption, RSA is usually combined with AES.

## 2. RSA Key Generation (Key Pair Creation)

What it is:\
RSA key generation produces a public/private key pair. The security comes from the difficulty of reversing the underlying math (notably, factoring very large numbers).

What you should understand (high level):

- RSA starts from large prime numbers internally
- It produces a public key and a private key that “fit together”
- You can distribute the public key openly
- The private key must remain secret

Try it (demo):

1. Open the RSA key generator
2. Generate a key pair
3. Save the public key and private key outputs for the next steps

## 3. RSA Encryption (Using the Public Key)

### What it is:

### \
RSA encryption is typically “public key encrypts → private key decrypts”.

Core idea:

- If I have your public key, I can encrypt a message for you
- Only you (with the private key) can decrypt it

Practical note (why RSA isn’t used for everything):\
RSA is not efficient for large data. It’s commonly used to encrypt small pieces of data like symmetric keys, not entire files.

Try it (demo):

1. Copy the public key from key generation
2. Enter a short message (example: “Meet me at 5PM”)
3. Encrypt using the public key
4. You get ciphertext

## 4. RSA Decryption (Using the Private Key)

What it is:\
RSA decryption uses the private key to recover the original message from ciphertext.

Core idea:

- Only the private key can reverse what was encrypted with the matching public key

Security implication:\
If a private key is leaked, any attacker can decrypt any message encrypted to that public key.

Try it (demo):

1. Copy the ciphertext produced in the encryption step
2. Paste the private key
3. Decrypt
4. Confirm you got the original plaintext back

## 5. RSA Signing (Using the Private Key)

Encryption hides content. Signatures prove authorship and detect tampering.

What it is:\
RSA signing uses the private key to produce a signature for a specific message.

What a signature guarantees (conceptually):

- Authenticity: the signer had the private key
- Integrity: the message has not changed since it was signed
- Non-repudiation (in many contexts): the signer cannot plausibly deny signing (especially in a certificate-based system)

Try it (demo):

1. Paste a message (example: “`I approve this transaction`”)
2. Paste the private key
3. Generate signature
4. Save the message + signature pair
