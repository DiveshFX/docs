title: "RSA vs AES (Documentation + Interactive Demos)"
description: "This documentation compares RSA and AES, two foundational cryptographic systems used across modern security (web, apps, files, authentication). It is designed as an explorable “documentation website” version of a presentation, with interactive demos linked throughout.

# Introduction

Cryptography is the practice of protecting information using mathematics. In modern computing, cryptography is mainly used to achieve:

1. Confidentiality — keep data secret from unauthorized parties
2. Integrity — detect if data has been modified
3. Authenticity — prove who created/sent the data
4. Non-repudiation — the sender cannot reasonably deny signing/approving something.

Two major families of encryption exist:

**A) Symmetric cryptography (AES)**

- One shared secret key encrypts and decrypts
- Very fast and efficient
- Main challenge: securely sharing that secret key

**B) Asymmetric cryptography (RSA)**

- Uses a public key + private key pair
- Public key can be shared openly; private key stays secret
- Solves key sharing and enables digital signatures
- Slower and heavier than symmetric encryption

If you remember one idea: AES is built to encrypt lots of data quickly, while RSA is built to securely exchange keys and prove identity (signatures). In practice, they are usually used together.

**Project Overview**

This project uses the online cryptography tools available at: https://diveshfx.github.io/online-tools/

The comparison is based on:

- Encryption type (symmetric vs asymmetric)
- Security level
- Performance and speed
- Key management
- Practical use cases
