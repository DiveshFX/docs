# Introduction

With the rapid growth of digital communication and online systems, securing data has become a critical requirement. Cryptography plays a major role in protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Among the most widely used encryption techniques today are **RSA** and **AES**.

This project focuses on a comparative study of **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** and **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**. Both algorithms are used extensively in modern security systems, yet they differ significantly in their design, performance, and use cases.

The purpose of this project is to analyze how RSA and AES work, highlight their strengths and limitations, and demonstrate their practical usage using browser based cryptography tools. By comparing these two encryption methods, this project helps users understand when and why each algorithm should be used.

# **Project Overview**

This project uses the online cryptography tools available at: https://diveshfx.github.io/online-tools/

The comparison is based on:

- Encryption type (symmetric vs asymmetric)
- Security level
- Performance and speed
- Key management
- Practical use cases
