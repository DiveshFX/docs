### 2.1 What is AES

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm. It uses **one shared secret key** for both encryption and decryption.

It is fast, secure, and widely used for encrypting large amounts of data.

### 2.2 AES Encryption Tool

This tool allows you to encrypt text or files using AES with customizable security settings.

#### Available Settings

- **Input Type**
  - Text
  - File
  - URL
- **Input Encoding**
  - UTF-8 (recommended)
- **Output Encoding**
  - Hex (lower case)
  - Base64
- **Key Size**
  - 128 bits
  - 192 bits
  - 256 bits
  - Recommendation: 256 bits
- **Mode**
  - CBC
  - CFB
  - OFB
  - CTR
  - GCM
  - CBC is common, GCM is recommended for authenticated encryption
- **Padding**
  - PKCS7 (default and recommended)
- **Key Type**
  - PBKDF2
  - EvpKDF
- **Passphrase**
  - Password used to derive the AES key
- **Hash**
  - SHA256 (recommended)
- **Salt Type**
  - Random (recommended)
- **Custom Iteration**
  - Allows control over PBKDF2 iteration count

### 2.3 How to Encrypt Data Using AES

1. Open the AES Encryption page
2. Select **Input Type** and enter your data
3. Choose **Key Size** (256 bits recommended)
4. Select **Mode** and **Padding**
5. Enter a strong **Passphrase**
6. Click **Encrypt**
7. The encrypted output will appear in the output panel

You can copy or share the encrypted result.

### 2.4 AES Decryption

To decrypt data:

1. Go to the AES Decryption section
2. Paste the encrypted output
3. Use the **same settings** as encryption
4. Enter the same passphrase
5. Click **Decrypt**

If all parameters match, the original data will be restored.
